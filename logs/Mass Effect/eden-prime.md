#Mass Effect 1 - Conversation Log

##What is this?
This is a log of my preferred conversation choices in Mass Effect 1.
Largely, for my own reference, so I don't have to keep re-playing various 
conversations when I forget.
####Joker & Alenko: He gave you a compliment, so you hate him.
- Cut the chatter.
- On my way.

####Pressly: Looks like we had a good run, Commander.
- He wants to see me.
- What do you mean?
- Investigate
	- Turian Spectre
	- That was long ago.
- I'll into it. ('See if I can get some answers when I see him') OR
	Goodbye ('I need to meet the Captain.')

####Dr. Chakwas & Pvt. Jenkins: What do you think Commander?
- Part of the job, Doc.
- It's just another mission.
- Don't play the hero.
- Goodbye.

####Nihlus: I was hoping you would get here first...
- Where's Captain Anderson?
- I wouldn't know.
- What's your point?

####Capt Anderson & Nihlus: This is far more that a simple shake-down run...
- That's obvious.
- What are we picking up?
- Prothean?
- You sound worried?
- I should have known.
- You put my name forward?
- You support this, Captain?
- I'm ready to go.
