#Mass Effect 1 - Conversation Log

##What is this?
This is a log of my preferred conversation choices in Mass Effect 1.
Largely, for my own reference, so I don't have to keep re-playing various 
conversations when I forget.

\* Re \`Our death.' : Possibly alluding to the ending of ME3?  Literally, the deaths of Anderson and Shepard.  Interesting to think that there might have been some subconscious prescience in the vision from the beacon.
