## introduction
This document provides a set of rules to govern permadeath Insanity
playthrough attempts of the _**Mass Effect Trilogy**_.  These rules
are originally based off of Twitch streamer [*@sizesixteens*]
(https://www.twitch.tv/sizesixteens) rules as he did most of [the
groundbreaking work on **Mass Effect** permadeath]
(http://bit.ly/2gwz9ID). His original rules are marked with an
asterisk (`*`).  In cases where he coincidentally adopted one
of these rules as his own, his rule's name is identified in
parenthesis.

In some cases I have tried to clarify specific edge cases and
questions that arose in the wording of his original rules. In
general I have tried to ensure these rules are more restrictive
and not less so than his own with the intent that this
rules set is a valid subset of [his original rules]
(http://bit.ly/2glAdQi).

The rest of the rules are my own spin and takes on the issue
of permadeath rules applicable to each game.  I also tried to
provide more formal definitions for common terms like `death` and
`void`, etc.

Shout out to *@sizesixteens* for the inspiration.  All mistakes
and oversights in this document are my own.

## definitions

The following definitions apply to this document:
- **death**: a `death` is defined as any time a
	"critical mission failure" is triggered.
- **void**: a `void` is any death or other even non-death
	situation where further game progress is impeded
	as a result of a _clear_, _demonstrable_, game engine
	or other glitch or failure, or any other "act of God."
	A `void` does not terminate the current playthrough
	nor does it confer any other penalty.  Play may be
	continued from the last saved game.
- **glitch**: a `glitch` is a catastrophic or terminal game
	ending or progress impeding state.  Examples include but
	are not limited to: player character trapped or stuck
	inside or outside the playable map area, non-player
	enemy that must be cleared for game progress purposes
	trapped or inaccessible inside or outside the playable
	map area, etc.
- **exploit**: an `exploit` is a trick or technique, whether 
	based on a glitch or game mechanics that either a)
	confers additional rewards (such as XP, Credits, or
	Renegade/Paragon points) than _reasonable assumptions_
	about game designer intentions would allow, b) is
	otherwise narratively illogical, or c) appears to
	otherwise circumvent _reasonable assumptions_ about
	game designer intent for the game experience.
	Tactical exploitation of known enemy behavior or 
	limitations in enemy combat AI is **not** considered
	to be an exploit.

## global rules `*`
- No `death` allowed. A dead Shepard is deleted across
	all games.
- A `void` may be allowed where and when applicable. See
	definition of `void` above.
- **Insanity** difficulty only.
- No mods that affect gameplay in any way.
	(Applicable only to PC)
- No intentional glitches or exploits.
	See definitions of these terms above.
- Must play and import the same character through all
	three games. Note: changing hairstyles, make-up, and
	to the extent possible, facial hair is acceptable.
- No re-allocation of squad points for anyone at anytime.  Note
	that Shepard's points may be de-allocated completely at the
	end of _Mass Effect 2_ as _Mass Effect 3_ can and does
	import these in often unwanted ways.
- No changing classes between games or changing bonus powers within
	the same game.
- No "New Game+".

## game specific rules

### Mass Effect
The following additional rules are applicable to _**Mass Effect**_.

#### Shortage `*`
All found equipment or looted equipment must be reduced to
omni-gel.  Any new equipment must be purchased either from
merchants, the _Normandy_ quartermaster, or received as
gifts from NPCs.

This speeds up game-play by doing away with virtually all
inventory management and the hacking mini-game.  It also
increases the apparent value of credit since all new gear
must be purchased from vendors while restricting the
exchange of copious amounts of looted equipment for 
additional cash. The general shortage of credit means
purchase decisions, when made, carry more significance.

Items explicitly recieved from NPCs are excepted from this
rule, as are Wrex's inventory items if he is killed on
Virmire.

I believe that Saren's loot items, dropped after he is
killed in the Council Chamber near the very end of the
game are also static. If that is the case, those items
are also excepted from this rule, though it hardly
matters at that point, since they are usually Level II
items.

#### Vanilla Rounds `*`
No weapons mods may be used by Shepard nor by any squad member.

Removing weapons mods from the game simplifies inventory management
and prevents abuse of elemental, anti-personnel/shredder, and
anti-synthetic/tungsten rounds which stall gameplay due to frequent
gear-swapping during combat situations.

Additionally, due to the credit restriction imparted by the
Shortage rule, taking away weapon mods implies, in theory, that
more credit will be available to purchase armor, armor mods, and
weapons and therfore that such equipment will be stronger or atleast
more evenly distributed amongst the team. Buying biotic-amps and
omni-tools also becomes more feasible.

#### Adept Privilege `*`
Singularity is banned as a bonus talent, limiting it to Adepts only.

In _Mass Effect_ Singularity is so absurdly broken that it's
almost always the best option in any tactical situation, esp.
at high levels: exposes and gathers all enemies within eight
(8) meters and, if followed up with Overload and Warp, one can
frequently gun down all or most of them.  This rule keeps the
Adept unique from all the other classes because its' other
offensive tools are shared with the Vanguard and Sentinel. A
Singularity-weilding Vanguard is particularly powerful because
it can use Adrenaline Rush to double-dip every biotic power
other than stasis, making it vastly superior to the Adept.

####  Safespace-free Zones (AKA Lockdown)
The party may not leave any building, facility, ship, or otherwise
exploit the so-called "zone" mechanic to retreat or regroup while
engaged in a fight. "Engaged in a fight" means that the menu
option to "save" the game is unavailable at the time in
question.

This rule is intended to prevent potential abuse of the
"zone mechanic", in which Shepard may, in the midst of combat,
leave a zone, collecting any fallen squadmates auto-magically,
and end the encounter to regroup in a "safe space".

A meta-exception exists in order to attempt to resolve
a glitched or trapped enemy who must otherwise be cleared
in order for the mission state to progress (and thus avoid
a `void`). This may only be done once all other enemies
are cleared from the zone.

#### Jarhead
For the Soldier class, bonus talents may be used for
any passive bonuses they apply (for example, Electronics
provides a passive shield bonus at all times) but not
used actively from the Power Wheel ever (i.e, Overload).

This exists for two reasons, the first principally being role-play,
maintaining the invariant that, as a Soldier, Shepard is always
both non-technical and a non-biotic. The second reason is that
combining the Soldier who already has Immunity and Adrenaline
Rush with an additional bonus talent that provides either the
critical stop-and-drop or AOE crowd-control abilities that
the Soldier is naturally lacking results in a highly over-
powered Soldier build.

In effect this rule makes the two "best" passive talents for
the Soldier either Electronics, for the passive shield bonus,
or Medicine for the passive bonus to medi-gel recharge.

#### Always in Regs
Shepard may only be equipped in armor that bears the `N7` logo.
Modded-armor meshes (that include the logo on other armor) are
not allowed.  In practice this restricts Shepard to wearing only
the Aldrin Labs `Onyx`-series of armors.

This rule is primarily about role-playing and intended to
maintain consistency in terms of look and feel with the later
games. Additionally, Onyx armor is relatively cheap when available
so enforcing this rule frees up more credits to equip the rest
of the team.

Level-IV Onyx armor is a static inventory item available from
the C-Sec Requisitions Officer on the Citadel, but obtaining
higher levels of Onyx Armor can be tricky. This rule therefore
makes the `Electronics` bonus power, with it's passive shield
bonuses, possibly the most valuable of all potential bonus
powers.

#### Med-clinic Economics
Dr. Chloe Michel's Wards Med-clinic offers by far the best
prices on all sold equipment.  This rule forbids selling her
any equipment.

Although various arguments could be made, i.e., that Dr.
Michel may, in turn, raise additional funds for her clinic
by reselling used weapons and equipment at a higher price, this
rule assumes that Dr. Michel is **not** running some kind of
weapons and equipment shop on the galactic-version of Ebay
on the side.  Dr. Michel's is treated as a sell-only shop
for reasons of narrative logic and immersion.

#### Spoils of War: Geth Pulse Rifle
An exception to the Shortage rule is made for the Geth Pulse
Rifle under the following conditions:

- A pulse rifle may be looted providing that it is immediately
	equipped by someone and that the weapon it replaces is
	itself reduced to omni-gel.
- The decision may be deferred to the equipping screen, but if 
	it is decided that the pulse rifle will not be equipped
	by a member of the squad then it must be immediately
	reduced to omni-gel (i.e., left behind).
- A pulse rifle may not later be sold to any vendor or merchant.

This rule is primarily for role-playing a sense of field loot
that feels a little bit logical and can occasionally even boost the
strength of the team's equipment in a believable way. The rifle is
considered to be un-sellable to reflect that 1) the market for
such equipment is likely small and 2) the military value of 
studying said equipment would preclude the possibility that 
one would sell it to a random merchant.

#### No License: Geth Armory
A Geth Armory license for the _Normandy_ quartermaster may
**not** be purchased.  It's ridiculous from both a role-playing
and narrative, world-building point of view.

In the unlikely event that Geth Armory equipment appears in
a vendor's store inventory it may still be purchased if desired.

#### Mineral of Opportunity
On any planet the Mako may travel between any marked points on
the map.  If in the course of traveling between marked points
a mineral is detected on ground radar the squad may choose to
make a reasonable diversion from the main objective to attempt
to locate and survey the mineral.

If it takes more than a minute or two of additional driving
or the mineral is located in such a way that relatively easy
access to it is not available (i.e., one must struggle over
peaks and valleys, and spend a long time figuring out how to
get to it) the mineral should be abandoned. There is some
subjectivity here, to be sure.

Additionally, if in the course of planetary exploration one
(1) or fewer minerals are surveyed, before leaving the planet
Shepard and crew may select a line of bearing from the Mako's
current location, mark, and drive in that direction for approx.
one to two maximum additional minutes in the hope of finding
minerals on the world. Whether anything is found or not, once
the Mako reaches it's active marker the crew should return to
the _Normandy_.

#### Narrative Play
Game-play must remain narrative.  This is intended to preclude
various XP and credit farming techniques that tend to ruin the
narrative flow of the game: i.e., entering a system, ignoring any
mission from Hackett et al that spawns, scanning the system for
credits, then leaving; dropping onto a planet to only fight the 
Thresher Maw, survey minerals, recover probes, etc.

Basically if you can't answer the question of why you are there
or what you are doing logically from Shepard's in-game perspective
you shouldn't be doing it.

Worlds and systems that the player feels unwilling or unable to
play to completion at the time in question should not be entered
into or landed upon until better ready to do so.

This rule is intended to keep a perma-death playthrough a character-
driven story rather than a mechanical and disjointed exercise in
XP and credit grinding.

### Mass Effect 2

#### Scorched Earth `*`
#### Small Arms `*`
#### Borrowed Time `*`
#### Toothless
Sniper Rifle-wielding squadmates Garrus, Thane, Legion, and Zaeed
are prohibited from carrying the M-29 Incisor Sniper Rifle.

The Incisor is so cool, but it has a serious ammo consumption
problem for Shepard, however it's fantastic for allies...perhaps
too fantastic.  The damage governor on this rifle was accidentally
left off so even on the hardest difficulties Shepard can literally
just run along behind a pair of Incisor-wielding teammates while
they demolish entire levels themselves.

It's awesome to watch but cheap as all and not very sporting
or very much within the spirit of a permadeath Insanity run, so
for this reason the M-29 is banned for squadmates.
